# Skepi
Skepi - Robotics competition submission - Gymnasio Antirriou

Almost completed - the uploaded code (in the src directory) is fully operational but specific funtionalities are, still, being worked on. We used several libraries and available modules, suitably modified for our goals (with appropriate acknowledgments) - see file wiring+libraries.odp in the presentations directory. The wiring+libraries.odp file shows the wiring of the project's devices.

Below we see a figure of the hardware set-up:
